### Detailed Component Description

#### 1. Core Kernel

**Kernel Initialization**
- Bootloader: Initializes the kernel and sets up the environment.
- Kernel Setup: Sets up interrupt handling, system timer, and other essential services.

**Memory Management**
- Physical Memory Manager: Manages physical memory allocation.
- Virtual Memory Manager: Manages virtual memory, including paging and segmentation.
- Cache Manager: Implements caching strategies to improve performance.

**Process Management**
- Scheduler: Implements process scheduling algorithms (e.g., round-robin, priority scheduling).
- IPC Mechanisms: Includes pipes, message queues, shared memory, and semaphores.
- System Calls: Provides an interface for user-space applications to request kernel services.

#### 2. File System Layer

**VFS (Virtual File System)**
- Abstract layer that provides a common interface for different filesystems.

**ext4+ (Hybrid ext4 Filesystem)**
- Inode Management: Extend the inode structure to store additional metadata for APK files.
    ```c
    struct ext4_inode {
        // Existing ext4 inode fields
        ...
        // Custom fields for APK metadata
        __le32 apk_metadata_offset;
        __le32 apk_metadata_size;
    };
    ```
- Directory Management: Handle directories with mixed content (regular files and APKs).
- File Operations: Implement custom operations for handling APK-specific tasks.
- APK Handler: Specialized module for managing APK files.
    - Metadata Extraction: Extract APK metadata and manage it within the filesystem.
    - APK Execution: Support execution of APKs on mobile devices.

#### 3. Memory Management

**Physical Memory Management**
- Manages allocation and deallocation of physical memory blocks.

**Virtual Memory Management**
- Implements paging and segmentation to provide virtual memory spaces for processes.
- Handles page faults and manages page tables.

**Cache Management**
- Implements strategies like LRU (Least Recently Used) for caching frequently accessed data.

#### 4. Process Management

**Process Scheduler**
- Implements various scheduling algorithms to manage CPU time allocation.

**Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
- Provides mechanisms for processes to communicate and synchronize.
- Includes pipes, message queues, shared memory, and semaphores.

**System Calls**
- Provides a user-space interface for kernel services.
- Includes calls for process management, file operations, and IPC.

#### 5. Device Drivers

**Block Device Drivers**
- Manage storage devices such as hard drives and SSDs.
- Implement read and write operations.

**Character Device Drivers**
- Manage devices like keyboards, mice, and serial ports.
- Implement character-based I/O operations.

**Network Device Drivers**
